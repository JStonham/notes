## Slightly smaller header

Used two hashes for slightly smaller header.


###### tiny header


## Code

```
select
*
from
*
```

Three backticks for a code block followed by code and then three more backticks.


```sql
select
*
from
*
```

Same as above, but with 'sql' straight after the first three backticks.
