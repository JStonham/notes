## Slightly smaller header

Used two hashes for slightly smaller header.


###### tiny header


## Code

```
select
*
from
*
```

Three backticks for a code block followed by code and then three more backticks.


```sql
select
*
from
*
```

Same as above, but with 'sql' straight after the first three backticks.

# Hello Dog

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("hello dog!");
    }
}
```

This is the syntax needed to create a very simple java application.

# Conditionals

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String name = "Jen";
        if (name.equals("Jen")){
            System.out.println("hello dogs!");
        } else {
            System.out.println("hello world!");
        }
    }
}
```
The simple syntax for creating java applications has been modified to add a conditional. A variable (condition) in the form of a String has been given the name Jen and, if the condition is met, hello dogs will be printed, if not, hello world will be printed.
