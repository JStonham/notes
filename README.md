# Notes

Notes for learning programming.

# Markdown

Markdown is a way of writing simple text files with some simple sugar to add formatting. It is well suited for simple technical documents as it supports monospaced text formatting, often with syntax highlighting.

## Headers:

Headers are written by starting a line with a `#` sign. The more `#` symbols you add the smaller the heading becomes.

```markdown
# Largest header
## Second largest header
### etc.
#### etc.
##### etc.
```

Try and not go any smaller than 4.

## Code

You can write code in two ways:

1. Surrounding text on a single line with backtick characters (\`), for example "\`Hello world\`" becomes `Hello world`.
1. Surrounding a block of text with triple backticks (\`\`\`). You can also specify a language syntax, for example SQL, by writing the name of the language after the first three backticks:
  ```sql
  SELECT
  *
  FROM
  *
  ```

# Java

# Hello ~World~ Dog

The simplest program you can write in Java, that actually does something, is about 5 lines of code:

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("hello dog!");
    }
}
```

This is the syntax needed to create a very simple Java application. It is the middle, `System.out.println("hello dog!");` sentence that's the important bit, as this piece of code will print `hello dog!` to the screen when run. Note that the semicolon at the end is mandatory.

# Conditionals

'If statements' or 'conditionals' is how a program can do different things based on the value of a variable.

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String name = "Jen";
        if (name.equals("Jen")){
            System.out.println("hello dogs!");
        } else {
            System.out.println("hello world!");
        }
    }
}
```
The simple syntax for creating Java applications has been modified to add a conditional.
A `String` variable called `name` has been given the value `"Jen"` and, if the variable indeed is `"Jen"` (i.e. the condition is met) `"hello dogs!"` will be printed, otherwise (`else`), `"hello world"` will be printed.

# Java Data Types

Java has some different data types to SQL. Here are some similarities and differences:

 SQL         | Java
--------------------------
`float`      | `float`
`date`       | `Date` (uppercase D)
`datetime`   | `DateTime` (uppercase D and T)
`int`        | `int`
`bigint`     | `long`
`varchar`    | `String` (uppercase S)
`null`       | `null`

Java also has some additional data types that SQL doesn't have:

1. `double` (higher precision `float`, use for all decimals)
1. `byte`
1. `boolean` (`true` or `false`)

# Variables

To write the following sentence in Java, variables need to be defined: "My name is Jen and I have 0 dogs. I walked 2.4 miles today. Flat earth theory is false."

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String name = "Jen";
        int dogsCount = 0;
        double milesWalked = 2.4;
        boolean earthTheory = false;
        String greeting = "My name is "+ name + " and I have " + dogsCount + " dogs. I walked " + milesWalked + " miles today. Flat earth theory is " + earthTheory + ".";
        System.out.println(greeting);
    }
}
```

There are 4 data types used in the above sentence: `String`, `int`, `double` and `boolean`.

`String` is used for `"Jen"` and most of the other words in the sentence, `int` is used for `0`, `double` is used for `2.4` and `boolean` is used for `false`.

The variables need a data type, then a name and then a value.

The `String` used for most of the sentence needs the format " " + String + " " + int + " " + double + " " + boolean + "." as the words need spaces between them and the sentence needs a full stop after the `boolean` condition.

# Nested Ifs

Introducing new operators...

Symbol | meaning
----------------
`||`     | or
`&&`     | and
`!`      | not

Don't use `!!` as this has the same effect as a double negative turning the value back to positive.

Both of the below `if`, `else if` and `else` statements have the same outcome, but the first statement uses `and`/`or` to remove the need for the second `else if`.

The statements have the following outcomes:
- If the `String name` is `"Jen"`/`"Roger"` and if `likesDogs` is `true` then `"hello dogs and Jen/Roger"` will be returned
- If `String name` is not `"Jen"`/`"Roger"` and if `likesDogs` is `true` then `"hello dogs"` will be returned
- If `likesDogs` is `false` then `"hello "+ name` will be returned (even if `String name` is `"Jen"`/`"Roger"`).

``` java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String name = "Walter";
        boolean likesDogs = true;

        // Using || to simplify logic
        if (likesDogs && (name.equals("Jen") || name.equals("Roger"))) {
            System.out.println("hello dogs and "+ name +"!");
        } else if (likesDogs) {
            System.out.println("hello dogs!");
        } else {
            System.out.println("hello "+ name +"!");
        }

        // The first two conditions look kind of similar. A sign that we can simplify
        if (likesDogs && name.equals("Jen")) {
            System.out.println("hello dogs and Jen!");
        } else if (likesDogs && name.equals("Roger")){
            System.out.println("hello dogs and Roger!");
        } else if(!(!likesDogs)) {
            System.out.println("hello dogs!");
        } else {
            System.out.println("hello "+ name + "!");
        }
    }
}
```

# Classes and Objects

Classes are moulds for objects. They define fields and methods that objects possess. The class itself doesn't have the object fields or possibility of using the object methods.

Example: Suppose we define a `Dog` object. A `Dog` has fields including `String collar`, `String colour` and `boolean microchipped`. It has one method called `bark()`.

To define the method of an object we need: a return type, a name (written in an imperative style), input argument(s) and a body (in curly brackets `{}`).

## Defining a class

The class below is how you would write the `Dog` class mentioned above.

``` java
public class Dog {
    String collar;
    String colour;
    boolean microchipped;

    String bark (double volume) {
        if (volume <= 5) {
            return "ruff";
        }
        return "woof";
    }
}
```

## Using an instance of a class

The code below will print 'Bertie says woof' as the input (`6`) was higher than 5.

``` java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Use 'new' to create an instance (object) from a class by invoking
        // its constructor ('Dog()')
        Dog bertie = new Dog();
        String bertieSays = bertie.bark(6);
        System.out.println("Bertie says " + bertieSays);
    }
}
```

# Enumerations (`enum`)

A finite list of possible values. Similar to objects in that it can have fields and methods. It's not possible to use the syntax 'new' with enum, as all possible instances are defined up-front by definition. For each possible enum value, what Java does under the hood is assign a number (called an 'ordinal') to each. Java really only knows about this number, but the programmer may use an easy-to-read name instead.

For example:

``` java
public enum FlingableObject {
    BALL,
    STICK,
    FRISBEE,
    TOY,
    HOT_DOG
}
```

# Case Statements within a Method

A list of cases, which in this case is within a method and returns a value for each enum option. Make sure to include a default return value at the end!

``` java
String fetch(FlingableObject flingableObject) {
        switch (flingableObject) {
            case TOY: return "That's not your toy, give it back!";
            case BALL: return "Good boy!";
            case STICK: return "Have a treat!";
            case FRISBEE: return "That's not what I threw!";
            default: return "I don't know what this is!";
        }
    }
```

# Using an enum

The statement below defines a method for playing fetch with a `Dog` named `scout`. I throw a flingable object (in this case a `BALL`), Scout fetches the ball, I say "Good Boy!"

``` java
public class Application {
    void run() {
        System.out.println("Jen throws "+ FlingableObject.BALL);
        String response = scout.fetch(FlingableObject.BALL);
        System.out.println("Jen says \"" + response + "\"");
        }
  }
```

# Using a For Loop

The `for` loop below effectively says: For all dogs, create a variable `dog` of type `Dog`, call the method (`bark(5000)`) and return what the dogs will say.

In the following example: The dogs are created one at a time (line by line) using a line from the 1st paragraph and the whole last paragraph. Once the 3 dogs have been created they are put into an array (2nd paragraph). The 3rd paragraph uses a `for` loop to say for all the dogs in the array (one at a time in the specified order), call the method (bark) and return what each dog will say.

``` java
public class Application {
    void run() {
        Dog pia = makeDog("Pia", 4);
        Dog bertie = makeDog("Bertie", 2);
        Dog scout = makeDog("Scout", 62);

        Dog[] dogs = new Dog[]{bertie, pia, scout};

        for (Dog dog : dogs) {
            String dogsSay = dog.bark(5000);
            System.out.println(dog.name + " says " + dogsSay);
        }

    }

    Dog makeDog(String dogName, int dogAge) {
        Dog dog = new Dog();
        dog.name = dogName;
        dog.age = dogAge;
        return dog;
    }

}
```

# Encapsulation

Encapsulation is one of the three main concepts in object oriented programming (the other two being 'inheritance' and 'polymorphism'). Encapsulation is about hiding the internal state and implementation details of how a class does what it does from other classes. The simplest (to the extent that it's basically redundant) example of encapsulation in Java is hiding fields behind dedicated methods for accessing and modifying the fields. Instead of just accessing the fields directly you have to call a method to get them. These fields can then only be accessed through defined `set` and `get` methods.

There are four levels of visibility modifiers: `public`, `protected`, package-private (the default) and `private`. For all except package-private the keyword must be used at the start. For package-private there is no keyword. For now just use `public` and `private`.

In the following example, the `public class Animal` has `private` fields of `age` and `limbsCount`, which can only be changed by using the defined `set` methods (`setLimbsCount()` and `setAge()`) and retrieved through the `get` methods (`getLimbsCount()` and `getAge()`).

``` java
public class Animal {
    private int age;
    private int limbsCount;

    public int getLimbsCount() {
        return limbsCount;
    }

    public void setLimbsCount(int limbsCount) {
        this.limbsCount = limbsCount;
    }

    public int getAge() {
        return age;
    }

    public void setAge(int age) {
        if (age >= 0) {
            this.age = age;
        }
    }
}
```

When writing the `set` method, remember to include `void` after `public` to let Java know you don't want to return any values. Also, to allow you to use the same word multiple times, write 'this.' before the field name to let Java know which word in the method links to the field and which variable refers to the input parameter.

When using the `get` method, remember to list the data type after `public`, and tell Java what to return.

Note - the `get` keyword is fine for get methods involving all data types except `boolean`. For `boolean`s, instead of `getFoo` use `isFoo`.

# Inheritance

Classes can inherit fields and methods from another, `super`, class. In the case of `Animal` there can be many animals so `Animal` is a superclass. The subclasses for `Animal` could be `Dog`, `Cat` and `Rabbit`. As these might all have similar features that other animals may not have, they can be further divided into `Pet`s, which would be a subclass of `Animal`.

In order to show that one class is a subclass of another, you should use the following syntax after `public`/`private class`: "sub class name" + extends + "super class name".

The following sub class `Pet` inherits the methods for getting and setting `age` and `limbsCount` from its superclass `Animal`, and also has a field called name. Note that the `Pet` class cannot see the `age` or `limbsCount` fields directly, as they are private - i.e. restricted only to the `Animal` class.

``` java
public class Pet extends Animal {
    private String name;

    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }

    public void setName(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }
}
```

The following class `Rabbit` is a subclass of `Pet`. It inherits the getters and setters for `name` from `Pet`, and for `age` and `limbsCount` from `Pet`'s superclass `Animal`.

`Rabbit` also has a field of `fluffDegree`, which `Pet` and `Animal` do not have.

``` java
public class Rabbit extends Pet {
    private String fluffDegree;

    public String getFluffDegree() {
        return fluffDegree;
    }

    public void setFluffDegree(String fluffDegree) {
        this.fluffDegree = fluffDegree;
    }
}
```

# Using Setters and Getters

The following code will make a new cat and a new rabbit with defined `name`, `age`, `limbsCount` and `fluffDegree` for the `Rabbit` only (The `Cat` class doesn't include or inherit this field).

We could use the `Animal` class to get the `age` and `limbsCount` of the `Cat` and `Rabbit`, but to get the `name` for both as well we need to use the `Pet` class.

``` java
public class Application {

    void run() {
        Pet tom = makeCat();
        Pet bugs = makeRabbit();

        Pet[] pets = {tom, bugs};

        for (Pet pet : pets) {
            System.out.println(pet.getAge());
            System.out.println(pet.getLimbsCount());
            System.out.println(pet.getName());
        }
    }

    private Rabbit makeRabbit() {
        Rabbit rabbit = new Rabbit();
        rabbit.setName("Bugs");
        rabbit.setAge(6);
        rabbit.setLimbsCount(3);
        rabbit.setFluffDegree("quite fluffy");
        return rabbit;
    }


    private Cat makeCat() {
        Cat cat = new Cat();
        cat.setName("Tom");
        cat.setAge(5);
        cat.setLimbsCount(4);
        return cat;
    }
}
```

# Abstract Classes

Classes can be defined as `abstract` classes. This means that the class is can fill in some, often most, of the blanks, but does not necessarily make sense to exist as a thing on its own.

Of the following classes:

- `Animal`
- `Pet`
- `Dog`
- `Cat`
- `Rabbit`

`Animal` and `Pet` should be considered abstract as there are many animals and many animals can be pets.

In order to define a class as abstract simply use the `abstract` keyword before defining the class.

``` java
public abstract class Animal {
}
```

``` java
public abstract class Pet extends Animal {
}
```

# Useful Windows Keyboard Shortcuts

`Alt + Enter` will help you out with almost anything!
To create a main method signature use shortcut `psvm`.
If you need to rename a class or a method - Refactor > Rename (`Shift + F6`).
`Ctrl + Alt + l` sorts out dodgy formatting e.g. lots of random spaces.

# Polymorphism

Polymorphism is the capability of a method, defined by a superclass (foreshadowing: or `interface`), to do different things based on the subclass(/implementation) instance that it is acting upon. It decouples a method's contract (method signature) from its implementation. (It stipulates what should be done, but allows for different implementations or calculations).

If we think of the class `Shape`, it would be an `abstract` class as there are many shapes. We want to calculate the circumference of these shapes. The problem is that the circumference for different shapes is calculated in different ways. Rather than putting all of the different methods into the `Shape` class, we put a constructor to say what we want, and force the problem of the method down into the subclasses.

A constructors looks like a method, but it has an implicit return type of the class it is defined in. It is used for setting up the initial state of an object. The name of a constructor is always the same as the name of the class. 

> Convention: When writing a class you tend to write it in the following order: fields, then constructors, then methods.

``` java
public abstract class Shape {
    public abstract double circumference();
}
```

We then create our `Shape` subclasses of `Circle`, `RightAngleTriangle` and `Rectangle`, each with their own methods for calculating their circumference.

### `Circle`

``` java
public class Circle extends Shape {
    private double radius;

    public Circle(double radius) {
        if (radius >= 0) {
            this.radius = radius;
        } else {
            System.out.println("ERROR: Radius needs to be a non-negative value.");
        }
    }

    public double circumference() {
        return 2*radius*Math.PI;
    }
}
```

This method includes a check that the radius entered is a non-negative value i.e. 0 or positive.

### `RightAngleTriangle`

``` java
public class RightAngleTriangle extends Shape {
    private double height;
    private double width;

    public RightAngleTriangle(double height, double width) {
        this.height = height;
        this.width = width;
    }

    public double circumference() {
        return height + width + hypotenuse();
    }

    private double hypotenuse() {
        return Math.sqrt(height * height + width * width);
    }
}
```

### Rectangle

``` java
public class Rectangle extends Shape {
    private double height;
    private double width;

    public Rectangle(double height, double width) {
        this.height = height;
        this.width = width;
    }


    public double circumference() {
        return 2 * height + 2 * width;
    }
}
```

### Calling the method of Circumference

We can then call the method `circumference()` on the abstract class `Shape` and its subclasses in the Main application.

``` java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Shape circle = new Circle(5); // A circle is-a shape
        Shape triangle = new RightAngleTriangle(3, 4); // A right-angle triangle is-a shape
        Shape rectangle = new Rectangle(3, 4); // A rectangle is-a shape

        // Only care that these objects are shapes, don't care exactly which Shape they are
        Shape[] shapes = {circle, triangle, rectangle};

        for (Shape shape : shapes) {
            System.out.println(shape.circumference());
        }
    }
}
```

The method `circumference()` is called for all shapes in `shapes`, and returns 3 values based on what height/width/radius has been selected and how the circumference of the individual shapes is calculated.

# Interfaces

To change an abstract class to an interface remove 'abstract' from class and methods and change 'class' to 'interface'. Public can be removed from methods as all interface methods are implicitly public.

### `Shape` Interface

``` java
public interface Shape {
    double circumference();
}
```

### `Rectangle` implementation of `Shape` Interface

Subclasses become implementations so change 'extends' to 'implements'.

``` java
public class Rectangle implements Shape {
    // (...)
}
```

# Differences between Abstract Classes and Interfaces in Java

- Both Abstract Classes and Interfaces are used for varying degrees of abstraction (defining relevant/irrelevant details and showing/hiding them from users).
- Abstract Classes are used for partial abstraction whereas Interfaces are used for full abstraction.
- As Abstract Classes are used for partial abstraction, they can have both abstract and concrete methods. Since Interfaces are used for full abstraction, they can only have abstract methods.
- In an Abstract Class, the 'abstract' keyword is mandatory to declare a method as abstract. In an Interface, the 'abstract' keyword is optional (redundant) as all Interface methods are abstract anyway.

Perhaps the biggest differences are:
1. An Abstract Class can extend only one class at a time whereas an Interface can extend multiple interfaces at the same time.
2. An Abstract Class can extend a concrete (regular) class or an abstract class, and it can also implement an interface. An interface can only extend another interface.

When we talk about abstract classes we are defining characteristics of an object type; specifying what an object is.

When we talk about an interface and define capabilities that we promise to provide, we are talking about establishing a contract about what the object can do.

For example, the following can all be animals: cat, dog, hippo, meerkat. However, only a cat or dog would lick people. In this case we could make `Animal` an abstract class where the animals can inherit certain characteristics, and `PeopleLicker` as an interface, which the cat and the dog would implement.

# Git Bash

Git is an application on your computer. It does not come with a pretty interface by default, so you will have to use the command line to use it. It is an application adjacent to code - I.e. it is not directly related to programming, but there are very few professional programmers who don't use it. It excels as a 'Version Control System'. There are some other systems you can use, but Git is the best and is dominating in terms of popularity. There are many Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) for Git e.g. IntelliJ. When you install Git on a Windows computer you generally also get a program called 'Git Bash'. Bash (Bourne Again SHell) is a program that facilitates the running of command line applications.

Your filesystem comprises directories (folders) and files. That's just about it. Git the notion of 'repositories'. Repositories are directories on steroids. Repositories are directories where git has been initialised, and starts tracking changes to the files inside it. This forms the basis of the version control system.

## Useful Bash commands

Command | description
---------------------
`history`  | shows the history of all commands that have been run
`cd`  | Change Directory
`ls`  | LiSt contents of current directory
`nano`  | A easy-to-use command line text editor
`cat`  | conCATenates/combines - shows you the file
`cp`  | CoPy file
`mv`  | MoVe file or directory. In Bash moving and renaming are the same operation
`rm`  | ReMove file - be VERY careful with this one, as files do not end up in the trash and are gone forever!

Concept | description
----------------------
`/`  | the 'root' directory. The highest directory you can navigate to; all other directories on your computer are somewhere beneath this one
`~`  | the home directory
`.`  | the current directory
`..`  | the directory above the current one
`-`  | the previous directory you navigated to

### Git commands

All of these commands must begin with `git` followed by a space.

Command | description
---------------------
`status`  | checking the state of a repository
`init`  | creates an repository with no commits from the current directory
`add`  | adds files where the names succeed the key word
`commit -m "<commit message here>"` | commits the files to the repository. The `-m` flag is needed so you don't open up your shell editor

## Git Repositories

We create repositories in Git to initialise a version control system and track the changes that are being made to the files within the directory the repository is made from.

1. To create a repository, `cd` to the directory you want to create the repository in.
1. Use `ls` to see everything that the directory contains.
1. Create the repository using `git init`.
1. Use `git status` to check the status of the repository.
1. Use `git add` followed by the full file names, or `.` for everything, to prepare files for adding to the repository.
1. Use `git status` to check the status of the repository.
1. Use `git commit` to commit (add) the files to the repository. Use `-m` followed by text in "" to add comments to the commit.
1. Commit messages are very good for explaining why you are doing things.
1. Use `git status` to check the status of the repository.
1. If there are files you want to be ignored or you want to create a space for future files to ignore, type `nano` followed by a file name to open the nano text editor and load a file. If no file is found nano will create one.
1. Use `git status` to check the status of the repository.
1. Use `git add` to prepare the to-be-ignored files for adding to the repository.
1. Use `git status` to check the status of the repository.
1. Use `git commit` to commit (add) the files to-be-ignored to the repository. Use `-m` followed by text in "" to add comments to the commit.
1. Use `git status` to check the status of the repository.
1. When you are done, you should get the message 'working tree clean'.

## Updating GitHub through Git Bash and Intellij

- `cd` into the repository you want to update.
- If you don't have the repository already, clone it to your computer using `git clone` followed by the full directory link (found using 'clone or download' on GitHub).
- Make sure you are working from the latest version by using `git pull`.
- update the file using a text editor.
- prepare the changes using `git add` followed by file name or `.`.
- commit the changes using `git commit` and add a message using `-m "[message text here]"`.
- push the changes to the orignal branch using `git push`.
- add reviewer on GitHub.

## A Plain Old Java Object (POJO) called `Transaction`

Create a class called `Transaction` with `private` fields of different types and setters and getters.

``` java
public class Transaction {
    private String type;
    private String description;
    private long money;

    public void setType(String type) {
        this.type = type;
    }
    public void setDescription(String description) {
        this.description = description;
    }
    public void setMoney(long money) {
        this.money = money;
    }
    public String getType() {
        return type;
    }
    public String getDescription() {
        return description;
    }
    public long getMoney() {
        return money;
    }
}
```

## Creating a Simple Successful Test

The beginning of test driven development (tdd). Tests must be:
- `public void`
- have no input arguments
- begin with `@Test`

There should be at least two classes. A main class and a test class.

```java
public class Bank {
    private long balance;

    public long add(Transaction transaction) {
        balance = balance + transaction.getMoney();
        balance += transaction.getMoney();
        return balance;
    }
}
```

Since the updated balance will be the balance plus the result of the transaction, we can simplify the code in line 4 to be the `+=` in line 5 and get rid of line 4.

``` java
import org.junit.Test;
import static org.junit.Assert.assertEquals;

public class BankTest {

    Bank bank = new Bank();

    @Test
    public void testZero() {
        Transaction transaction = makeTransaction(0);
        assertEquals(0, bank.add(transaction));
    }

    @Test
    public void test() {
    public void testFive() {
        long balance = bank.add(makeTransaction(5));
        assertEquals(5, balance);
    }
```

3 in 1 positive and negative test:
Look closely at what is expected in the `assertEquals` after each new transaction is made.

``` java
    @Test
    public void testTransaction() {
        Transaction transaction1 = makeTransaction(10);
        assertEquals(10, bank.add(transaction1));
        Transaction transaction2 = makeTransaction(-8);
        assertEquals(2, bank.add(transaction2));
        Transaction transaction3 = makeTransaction(4);
        assertEquals(6, bank.add(transaction3));
    }

    private Transaction makeTransaction(long money) {
        Transaction transaction = new Transaction();
        transaction.setMoney(money);
        return transaction;
    }
}
```

## `Transactions`

Looking back at the requirements for budjen:
"Each transaction will include a transaction type, a transaction reason and a number of money in pounds sterling."

``` java
public class Transaction {
    private String type;
    private String description;
    private long money;

    public void setType(String type) {
        this.type = type;
    }
    public void setDescription(String description) {
        this.description = description;
    }
    public void setMoney(long money) {
        this.money = money;
    }
    public String getType() {
        return type;
    }
    public String getDescription() {
        return description;
    }
    public long getMoney() {
        return money;
    }
}
```

## Test Driven Development (TDD)

TDD rules:
1. RED. Write as little test code as possible to make your production code fail.
1. GREEN. Write as little production code as possible to make your test pass.
1. REFACTOR. Clean up the code. (Not allowed to change the behaviour of the production code).

The classes Bank and BankTest now become:

``` java
public class Bank {
    private long balance = 0;
    public long getBalance() {
        return balance;
    }
    public void addTransaction(Transaction transaction) {
        balance += transaction.getMoney();
    }
}

public class BankTest {
    public static final long BIG_NUMBER = 64000000000l;
    private Bank bank = new Bank();

    @Test
    public void hasZeroBalanceByDefault() {
        assertEquals(0, bank.getBalance());
    }

    @Test
    public void canHandleMultipleTransactions() {
        bank.addTransaction(makeTransaction(128));
        bank.addTransaction(makeTransaction(-256));
        bank.addTransaction(makeTransaction(64));
        assertEquals(-64, bank.getBalance());
    }

    @Test
    public void canHandleVeryLargeAmountsOfMoney() {
        bank.addTransaction(makeTransaction(BIG_NUMBER));
        assertEquals(BIG_NUMBER, bank.getBalance());
    }

    private Transaction makeTransaction(long money) {
        Transaction transaction = new Transaction();
        transaction.setMoney(money);
        return transaction;
    }
}
```

The class `Transaction` needs a `TransactionTest` class:

```java
import org.junit.Test;
import static org.junit.Assert.*;
public class TransactionTest {

    @Test
    public void givenNoData_returnsNoDataMessage() {
        String summary = new Transaction().getSummary();
        assertEquals("No data.", summary);
    }

    @Test
    public void givenMoney_returnsMonetaryDescription() {
        String summary = makeTransaction().getSummary();
        assertEquals("You have £10", summary);
    }

    @Test
    public void givenPositiveMoney_returnsMonetaryValue() {
        long money = makeTransaction().getMoney();
        assertEquals(10, money);
    }

    private Transaction makeTransaction() {
        Transaction transaction = new Transaction();
        transaction.setMoney(10);
        return transaction;
   }
}
```

To make 2 of these tests pass, we need to add a method to the `Transaction` class:

``` java
    public String getSummary() {
        if (money == 0) {
            return "No data.";
        }
        return "You have £10";
    }
```

So that was positive money, but how about negative money?

``` java
    @Test
    public void givenNegativeMoney_returnsNegativeMonetaryValue() {
        long money = makeNegativeTransaction().getMoney();
        assertEquals(-20, money);
    }

    @Test
    public void givenNegativeMoney_returnsMonetaryDescription() {
        String summary = makeNegativeTransaction().getSummary();
        assertEquals("You have spent £20", summary);
    }

    private Transaction makeNegativeTransaction() {
        Transaction transaction = new Transaction();
        transaction.setMoney(-20);
        return transaction;
    }
```

Which means we need to add lines 5-7 of the following to Transaction:

``` java
    public String getSummary() {
        if (money == 0) {
            return "No data.";
        }
        if (money <0) {
            return "You have spent £20";
        }
        return "You have £10";
    }
```

The amount of money I have spent or I have can be refactored:

``` java
    public String getSummary() {
         if (money == 0) {
            return "No data.";
        }
        if (money <0) {
            return "You have spent £" + (money * -1);
        }
        return "You have £" + money;
    }
```

Now, what about zero money?

``` java
    @Test
    public void givenZeroMoney_returnsZeroMonetaryValue() {
        long money = new Transaction().getMoney();
        assertEquals(0, money);
    }
    @Test
    public void givenZeroMoney_returnsMonetaryDescription() {
        String summary = new Transaction().getSummary();
        assertEquals("No data.", summary);
    }
```

Tests and method for Transaction description:

``` java
    @Test
    public void givenDescription_returnsDescription() {
        String description = makeDescription().getDescription();
        assertEquals("Rent",description);
    }
    @Test
    public void givenNullDescription_returnsNullDescription() {
        String description = new Transaction().getDescription();
        assertNull(description);
    }
    @Test
    public void givenEmptyDescription_returnsDescription() {
        String description = makeEmptyDescription().getDescription();
        assertEquals("",description);
    }
    private Transaction makeDescription() {
        Transaction transaction = new Transaction();
        transaction.setDescription("Rent");
        return transaction;
    }
    private Transaction makeEmptyDescription() {
        Transaction transaction = new Transaction();
        transaction.setDescription("");
        return transaction;
    }
```

The 3rd test above is a dangerous test. Essentially it is allowing an empty description to be set (which we don't want to allow).

Tests on Transaction Date:

``` java
import java.util.Date;
    @Test
    public void givenDate_returnDate() {
        Date date = new Date();
        Transaction transaction  = new Transaction();
        transaction.setDate(date);
        assertEquals(date, transaction.getDate());
    }
    @Test
    public void givenNullDate_returnDateToday() {
        Date today = new Date();
        Transaction transaction = new Transaction();
        transaction.setDate(null);
        assertEquals(today, transaction.getDate());
    }
```

And of course we need to modify the Transaction class to make these tests pass by adding a date field and set-ers and get-ers:

``` java
import java.util.Date;
private Date date;
public void setDate(Date date) {
        this.date = date;
    }
public Date getDate() {
        return date;
    }
```

We can change this code so that if the date is null the date returned will be today...

``` java
public Date getDate() {
        if (date == null) {
            return new Date();
        }
            return date;
    }
```

The problem with this code is that if the transaction date is null, by the time we get the date it might be slightly different to the date that was set (e.g. 1 second out). This means we need to set the date in the setDate method rather than the getDate method:

``` java
public void setDate(Date date) {
        this.date = date;
        if (date == null) {
            this.date = new Date();
        }
        else {
            this.date = date;
        }
    }
public Date getDate() {
        return date;
    }
```

## TDD with a new money format

So far we have been thinking about money in terms of whole pounds... but what do we need to do if we want to think about money in terms of pence?

We can modify our existing Transaction Tests to include pence:

``` java
@Test
    public void givenMoney_returnsMonetaryDescription() {
        String summary = makeTransaction().getSummary();
        assertEquals("You have £10", summary);
        assertEquals("Your account has been credited with £10.00", summary);
    }
    @Test
    public void givenPositiveMoney_returnsMonetaryValue() {
        long money = makeTransaction().getMoney();
        assertEquals(10, money);
        assertEquals(1000, money);
    }
    private Transaction makeTransaction() {
        Transaction transaction = new Transaction();
        transaction.setMoney(10);
        transaction.setMoney(1000);
        return transaction;
    }
    @Test
    public void givenNegativeMoney_returnsNegativeMonetaryValue() {
        long money = makeNegativeTransaction().getMoney();
        assertEquals(-20, money);
        assertEquals(-2000 , money);
    }
    @Test
    public void givenNegativeMoney_returnsMonetaryDescription() {
        String summary = makeNegativeTransaction().getSummary();
        assertEquals("You have spent £20", summary);
        assertEquals("You have spent £20.00", summary);
    }
    private Transaction makeNegativeTransaction() {
        Transaction transaction = new Transaction();
        transaction.setMoney(-20);
        transaction.setMoney(-2000);
        return transaction;
    }
    @Test
    public void givenNegativeMoney_returnsMonetaryDescription2() {
        String summary = makeNegativeTransaction2().getSummary();
        assertEquals("You have spent £20.01", summary);
    }
    private Transaction makeNegativeTransaction2() {
        Transaction transaction = new Transaction();
        transaction.setMoney(-2001);
        return transaction;
    }
```

Simply adding pence as 00 is fine when we are still working in whole pounds, but to get the actual pence (the remainder of a whole pound) we need to do:
`a % b = c `

A big number divided by another number will give a number of whole values and a remainder. It is the remainder we are interested in.

For example, in 15 % 10 = 5, 10 goes into 15 once, with 5 as the remainder.

Some other examples:
- 25 % 10 = 5
- 13 % 6 = 1
- 64 % 255 = 64
- 146 % 12 = 2

We can create a class called Currency to give us the pence:

``` java
public class Currency {
    public String formatPounds(long i) {
        if (i == 0) {
            return "0";
        }
        long remainder = i % 100;
        String pence = remainder < 10 ? "0" + remainder : "" + remainder;
        return "£" + (i / 100) + "." + pence;
    }
}
```

The code `remainder < 10 ? "0" + remainder : "" + remainder` works as an if-else statement. i.e. If the remainder is less than 10, then 0 + remainder, else "" + remainder.

With the Currency class, we need a Currency Test class:

``` java
import org.junit.Test;
import static org.junit.Assert.assertEquals;
public class CurrencyTest {
    @Test
    public void givenZero_givesZero() {
        runTest("0", 0);
    }
    @Test
    public void given5Pounds_gives5Pounds() {
        runTest("£5.00", 500);
    }
    @Test
    public void given42Pence_gives42Pence() {
        runTest("£0.42", 42);
    }
    private void runTest(String s, int i) {
        assertEquals(s, new Currency().formatPounds(i));
    }
 }
```

We can also modify the `getSummary` method in the Transaction class to tell us exactly how much money was involved in the transaction.

``` java
public String getSummary() {
         if (money == 0) {
            return "No data.";
        }
        if (money <0) {
            return "You have spent " + new Currency().formatPounds(-money);
        }
        return "Your account has been credited with " + new Currency().formatPounds(money);
    }
```

Always remember to REFACTOR!! There could be unused imports or multiple assertions that could be put into the same Test.

This code

``` java
private Date date;

public void setDate(Date date) {
        if (date == null) {
            this.date = new Date();
        }
        else {
            this.date = date;
        }
}
```

could be changed to

``` java
private Date date = new Date();

public void setDate(Date date) {
        if (date != null) {
            this.date = date;
        }
        else {
            this.date = date;
        }
}
```

## Exceptions

An exception is a disruption to the execution of a program. There are a few reasons why an exception can occur, including:
- Data requested is out of range (e.g. Data held is 1-5 and I ask for record 8).
- File cannot be found.
- Network connection was interrupted.

There are two types of exceptions:
1. Checked Exceptions
1. Unchecked Exceptions

Checked exceptions have to be handled when a program is compiled. The programmer is forced to build in a way of handling these exceptions by the compiler.

Unchecked exceptions do not have to be handled when a program is compiled. It is up to the programmer to handle them at runtime.

Java documents states: "If a client can reasonably be expected to recover from an exception, make it a checked exception. If a client cannot do anything to recover from the exception, make it an unchecked exception".

In Java, the `Exception` class is checked, but the `RuntimeException` class is unchecked.

Exceptions should be handled to enable the safe execution of a program. Ideally exceptions need to be handled as closely as possible to make the execution more performant.

The way we **handle** exceptions is using the try/catch syntax.

We `try` the method that will throw an exception and we `catch` the result of that exception.

By catching the exception we allow the program to continue executing, although instead of the expected behaviour the program must adapt to the unexpected event.

``` java
import org.junit.Test;
 public class ExceptionPracticeTest {
    @Test
    public void exceptionTest() {
        a();
    }
    private void a() {
        b();
    }
    private void b() {
        c();
    }
    private void c() {
        d();
    }
    private void d() {
        e();
    }
    private void e() {
        try {
            // We think something might go wrong here
            f();
        } catch (JenException re) {
            // If something (a JenException) happens, execute this code
            String bob = re.getBob();
            System.out.println(bob.equals("agergaerg"));
        }
    }
    private void f() {
        g();
    }
    private void g() {
        h();
    }
    private void h() throws JenException {
        //Oops, something went wrong.
        //Better throw a JenException
        throw new JenException("Doesn't matter");
    }
}
class JenException extends RuntimeException {
    private String bob;
     JenException(String message) {
        super(message);
    }
    public String getBob() {
        return bob;
    }
}
```

## Creating a bash alias

To create an alias, we need to create and modify a file that will contain our alias.

- Open text editor for file containg alias: `nano ./.bashrc`
- Edit file: `alias shortcut="full command"`. Recommend not using spaces around `=`
- Write Out, Enter and Exit text editor.
- Enable use of shortcut straight away: `source ./.bashrc`

## Injected vs Hard-Coded Dependencies

Injected Dependencies provide the variables that a class needs (its dependencies) by injecting them into the class's contructor, instead of the class having to construct them itself as Hard-Coded Dependencies.
Dependency injection is a form of object delegation rather than object inheritance. i.e. it is in the form of an object has-a rather than an object is-a relationship. This can be especially useful when designing and testing an application.
- Hard-Coded Dependencies are OK when your class depends on an aspect that is not going to change, e.g. it depends on a sorter that will always be needed to sort in the same way.
- Injected Dependencies are useful if you know there is something you will always need, like data, but the data itself might change. Injected dependencies *do* require you to do more work.

## Generics

Type safety adds stability to your code by making more of your bugs detectable at compile-time, rather than waiting for things to go wrong at run-time.
Generics allow type safety between classes in a 'of-a' relationship with each other.

With Generics, you can set the generic type to be a non-primitive type e.g. Integer and then if you pass in a String you will get a compile-time error.

The syntax for Generics is read 'A-of-B', e.g. an AnimalShelter-of-dogs:

```java
AnimalShelter<Dog>
```

## Changing Arrays into Lists

Arrays (e.g. `[]String`) can be useful if you have a simple ordered collection of elements that will not change much, but if you want more capabilities (e.g. to add or remove objects from the list) you will need to use a List.

The syntax for creating an array is:
``` java
new Type[] { /*comma-separated elements*/ }
```

Example:
```java
public Transaction[] getTransactionData() {
    return new Transaction[] {
        credit("",money,date)
        debit("",money,date)
    };
}
```

The syntax for creating a list is:
```java
Arrays.asList( /* comma-separated elements*/)
```

Example:

```java
public List<Transaction> getTransactionData() {
    return Arrays.asList(
        credit("",money,date)
        debit("",money,date)
    );
}
```
As Array is a class, we can create a new instance of it. Since List is an interface, we cannot directly create a `new List` but have to use other ways of creating `List`s from any number of elements.

The most common ways of doing this are the following two:

```
List<String> a = Arrays.asList("foo", "bar");

// and

List<String> b = new ArrayList<>()
b.add("foo");
b.add("bar");
```

To test how many objects are in an array or a list, you use `.length` (public field) for array and `.size()` (public method) for list. Example:

### `Array`

```java
assertEquals(16, transactions.length);
```

`List`

```java
assertEquals(16, transactions.size());

```
To assert that arrays/lists are identical in tests you can do:

`Array`

```java
assertArrayEquals(expected, actual);
```

`List`

```java
assertEquals(actual.size(), expected.size());
for (int i = 0; i < actual.size(); i++) {
    assertEquals(expected.get(i), actual.get(i));
}
```

JUnit has a built in method for testing how many objects are in an array, but not how many are in a list.

The code above for testing the size of a list states that for every object in the list, from 0 to less than the size of the list, check expected against actual and then move to the next object in the list.

## Packages

Packages allow users to organise different sets of classes and interfaces into related groups. They are similar to folders in a file structure, with classes/interfaces being the files. In fact, this is exactly what they are on the file system; folders and source files.

Packages are also useful in terms of expanding the privileges of certain classes to view other classes.

There are four levels of protection for fields, methods, classes etc:
- `public` (available to all other classes)
- `protected` (available to the class, its subclasses and any classes in the same package)
- package private (default, available to the class and any classes in the same package)
- `private` (only available to that class)

Access Levels

```
|   Modifier  | Class | Package | Subclass | World |
| ----------- | ----- | ------- | -------- | ----- |
| public      |   Y   |    Y    |     Y    |   Y   |
| protected   |   Y   |    Y    |     Y    |       |
| no modifier |   Y   |    Y    |          |       |
| private     |   Y   |         |          |       |
```
